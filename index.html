    Mr. Chan told us to type whatever we want so...I lit rally have no idea what we're doing but I think I'm starting to understand
    it. I'm excited to go home because I'm so TIRED. I think I'm just gonna rant about what's happening in my life... I need to 
    finish my application for Seattle University and the University of Washington. Did you know that it costs $14.37 to send ACT 
    scores... I have to send it 3 times!! I also have to pay $55 for SU and $80 for UW. Seattle Pacific University waived my 
    application fee so I was lucky.
    <p><h2>But here's a <i>new</i> paragraph.</h2>
