    I lit rally have no idea what we're doing but it looks cool. I'm excited to go home because I'm so TIRED, imagine how tired I am.
    I need to finish my application for Seattle University and the University of Washington. Did you know that it costs $14.37 to send 
    ACT scores... I have to send it 3 times maybe even 4 times!! I also have to pay $55 for SU and $80 for UW. Seattle Pacific
    University waived my application fee so I was lucky.
