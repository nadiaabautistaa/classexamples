    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Welcome to my web page! This is the <i><b>first</b></i> example from class. I hope you like it.
    <p>Here's another paragraph.
    I typred this ine without another paragraph tag, so it should appear right next to the previous 
    sentence. The web page doesn't preserve the same spacing. It formats according to the tags it sees.
    So the line 
    breaks
    are
    different
    from the 
    source
    also. <p><h2>But here's a <i>new</i> paragraph.</h2>
    <br><br><br>And a couple more blank lines afterward...
